          <h3>D. Trump</h3>
          <p>America has a huge household deficit but thanks to this App, we have a path on how to solve the problem! It even calculates when the debt will be payed off, now we just need to figure out what the "&infin;" sign means in the "remaining time" field.</p>

          <h3>Elon Musk</h3>
          <p>I love this app! We suggest it to everyone who plans to leave Earth and travel to Mars with us but currently lacks the funds. This is creating new customers for our future planetary travel business!</p>

          <h3>Waren Buffet</h3>
          <p>Seriously, the Investment suggestions are pure Gold. Everything I learned in 50 years on Wallstreet is now automated thanks to this app. I could have retired with 20 if this existed in my time.</p>

          <h3>Bill Gates</h3>
          <p>I never had any needs to safe Money. I always sold bad working software to people without a clue. Perhaps I buy this app too and market it myself. It fits perfectly into the line up.</p>
